# How to caption

There's some info in the [tools repo](https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream) for using BLIP to [automate much of the work](https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream/blob/main/doc/AUTO_CAPTION.md).  If you use BLIP, make sure you also look at the filerename script to fix up the generic pronouns BLIP spits out.  Info is in the tools repo on this, please review.

# Subjects

Typically a subject caption would start with the subject name or "a close up of".  You can take hints from how BLIP sees the image.  Try to write a sentence describing the image.

"bob robertson in a black tuxedo posing for a photo at a red carpet event"
"A close up of bob robertson looking at the camera smiling"
"bob robertson standing on a beach in swimtrunks facing away from the camera with a beautiful sunset and the ocean in the background"

# Multisubject

It's better to put the name closer to the start and focus less on outfits.  If you do include outfit info, keep in brief.

"bob robertston and jane smith sitting together on a bench in a park"

"jane smith and bob robertston facing each other"

"bob robertston sitting on a chair next to jane smith standing with her hand on his shoulder"

"bob robertson in a suit and jane smith in a red dress sitting next to each other in a busy bar room with a bottle of wine on the bar next to them"
